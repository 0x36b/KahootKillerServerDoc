# KahootKiller Server How-to
* So I feel like was necessary, Here is all the steps to make your own KahootKiller Server!



## Step One
* Install Node-JS from https://nodejs.org/en/.
## Setp two
* open terminal and type
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/BrandonPlank/Kahoot-Smasher-Server
* cd Kahoot-Smasher-Server
* node start
## Step three
* Now you can connect to the server with the MacOS Kahootkiller by typing localhost in the server ip section, or you can find the ip of your computer on the wifi network and connect your iOS device to that ip in the server section. **NOTE** Your device must be on the same network as your computer unless you port forward! 
## Thats it?!?!?!?!?
* Yep have fun!
